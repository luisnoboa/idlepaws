The game now properly begins with guidance on:

- Finding and recruiting trustworthy companions (with Suspicion skill)
- Building defensive structures through the new building tab
- Expanding more cautiously with the new knowledge

## Implementation Notes

- All tutorial highlights and tooltips should be unobtrusive but clear
- Resource generation rates should be boosted during tutorial phase
- Tutorial should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete
- Ensure all UI elements are highlighted in sequence as they become relevant
- The betrayal should happen after a game restart to create a stronger impact
- Post-betrayal guidance should be comprehensive but allow more player freedom
- Consider making the stuffed mouse provide an enhanced "Determination" bonus after betrayal

## Gameplay Balancing

- Post-betrayal starting state should balance challenge with playability
- Provide a small stockpile of emergency resources in a hidden cache
- First post-betrayal recruitable companion should have high loyalty stats
- Consider adding an optional "revenge" questline with significant rewards
