## New Game Systems Unlocked

### Trust and Loyalty Mechanics

**Introduction:** After the betrayal, new mechanics are introduced:

1. **Trust System**
   - New attribute "Suspicion" appears in player stats
   - Tutorial explaining how to gauge NPC trustworthiness
   - Loyalty meters for all future companions
   - Actions that increase/decrease trust are explained

2. **Settlement Defense**

   - Introduction to territory marking mechanics
   - Warning systems for potential threats

3. **Reputation System**

   - Introduction to factions within the stray cat world
   - Ability to form alliances or rivalries

### Building Integrity System

**Introduction:** New mechanics related to building maintenance:

1. **Building Degradation**
   - Buildings now deteriorate over time without maintenance
   - Weather events can damage structures
   - Repair mechanics are introduced

2. **Construction Quality**
   - Materials quality affects building durability
   - Skilled builder cats improve construction integrity
   - Protective measures against future raids

### The True Beginning

The game now properly begins with:
- Rebuilding the damaged settlement
- Learning to identify trustworthy companions
- Establishing proper defenses
- Expanding more cautiously with new knowledge

## Implementation Notes

- The tutorial should feel generous with resources to create a stark contrast with the post-betrayal reality
- Time acceleration during tutorial should create a sense that progress is easy and quick
- NPC behavior during tutorial should subtly hint at potential betrayal for observant players
- The "Suspicion" stat should be retroactively shown to have been at 0 during tutorial
- Consider adding an optional "revenge" questline to recover stolen resources from Patches
- Ensure players understand this twist is part of the game narrative, not a punishment
- Provide clear guidance on how to rebuild and use new mechanics after the reset

## Gameplay Balancing

- Post-betrayal starting state should be challenging but not overwhelming
- Some form of "comeback" mechanic helps players rebuild faster than the first time
- The stuffed mouse memento could provide an enhanced bonus after betrayal (representing determination)
- First post-betrayal recruitable companion should be especially loyal to contrast with Patches
