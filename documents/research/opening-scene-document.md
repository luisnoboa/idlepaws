# Idle Paws: Opening Scene

## Overview
The opening scene establishes the emotional foundation for Idle Paws, giving the player's cat character a compelling backstory that justifies the gameplay mechanics of survival, building, and exploration.

## Scene Sequence

### Scene 1: The Photograph
A worn photograph appears on screen, showing a happy family—parents and a small child—on their farm. The child is holding a small kitten, both looking joyful. The image has a warm, golden-hour glow.

### Scene 2: Transition to Reality
The photograph dissolves into a live scene. The child is playing with the kitten in a sunlit field near their farmhouse. Laughter echoes as they play a game of chase. The kitten is playfully batting at the child's shoelaces.

### Scene 3: The Distraction
The kitten's ears perk up suddenly, attention caught by something rustling in the tall grass. A tiny movement—perhaps a field mouse or grasshopper—pulls the kitten away from the child. The child calls after: "Whiskers, come back!"

### Scene 4: The Chase
The kitten (now named Whiskers) pounces deeper into the field, completely absorbed in the hunt. The joyful music fades as the camera pans upward, revealing dark storm clouds gathering rapidly on the horizon. Wind begins to bend the grass.

### Scene 5: The Warning
A weather alert siren wails in the distance. The parents rush out from the farmhouse, calling frantically for their child. The mother's voice carries over the rising wind: "Come inside now! Quickly!"

### Scene 6: Left Behind
The parents rush the child toward the house, looking back briefly for the kitten but unable to find it in the tall grass. The father shouts, "We can't wait!" as they disappear inside, the door slamming shut against the intensifying wind.

### Scene 7: The Realization
Whiskers emerges from the grass, prey forgotten, to find the house sealed tight. The kitten paws desperately at the door, meowing plaintively. Inside, muffled voices and movement can be heard, but no one comes to the door.

### Scene 8: The Storm Unleashes
The sky darkens completely. Rain begins to fall in heavy sheets as debris starts to fly. In the distance, a tornado touches down, carving a path directly toward the farm. The kitten, soaked and terrified, searches frantically for shelter.

### Scene 9: Finding Shelter
Whiskers spots the barn and dashes toward it, narrowly avoiding being struck by flying debris. Inside, the kitten finds a drainage pipe and crawls inside, shivering and mewling softly as the storm rages louder.

### Scene 10: The Destruction
The scene shifts to an aerial view as the tornado tears through the property. The farmhouse is ripped apart, the barn's roof peels away like paper. Through it all, a small drainage pipe remains partially intact, protected by its position against the ground.

### Scene 11: The Aftermath
Dawn breaks on a devastated landscape. Whiskers cautiously emerges from the pipe to find a world transformed. Where the farmhouse stood is nothing but scattered debris. The barn is half-collapsed.

### Scene 12: The Search
The kitten carefully picks through the wreckage of the farmhouse, searching for any sign of the family. A child's torn stuffed animal lies in the mud. Whiskers sniffs it, then sits down and lets out a mournful meow.

### Scene 13: The Memento
Whiskers gently pulls the small stuffed mouse toy from the debris. The kitten clutches it close, finding unexpected comfort in this remnant of its former life.

- **Hope** - Finding other cats and building a new community
