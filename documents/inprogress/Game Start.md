# Building System - Initial Setup

- **Starting Dwelling**: Based on the tutorial choice (stay or journey), players have a simple shelter that serves as their home base
- **Initial Structure**: Likely damaged after the tutorial's betrayal event, requiring some repairs
- **Building UI**: Shows the current dwelling with options to repair/upgrade
- **Building Requirements**: Lists the resources needed for repairs (potentially catnip, twigs, etc.)

### Exploration System - Initial Map
- **Starting Location**: Players see a map of their immediate area
- **Gathering Nodes**: Various resource nodes are visible on this map (catnip patches, twig piles, etc.)
- **Node Interaction**: Players can click on these nodes to gather resources
- **Energy System**: Each gathering attempt costs energy
- **Resource Yields**: Different nodes yield different resources with varying success rates

### Gameplay Flow
1. Players explore the starting map area
2. They click on resource nodes to gather basic materials
3. Resources are used to repair and eventually upgrade their dwelling
4. This unlocks more cats, which can be assigned to gather resources
5. Eventually, they'll unlock new exploration areas with better resources

This creates the foundation of your core gameplay loop - exploration leads to resource gathering, which enables building, which in turn unlocks more exploration options.
